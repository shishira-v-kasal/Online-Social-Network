                   Recommendation systems for SNS’s is a new scope of research as social peoples are more interested in online social networking (OSN) sites, like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr , LinkedIn, MySpace, Google Plus etc. In the social networking sites, a social entity or user makes connections with other known or unknown social entities, namely friends or partners, and share their news and views through the profound facilities of the sites. Friends could be offline or real-life friends, classmates, neighbors, colleagues, family members, relatives or anyone having a profile in the OSN sites.

                Recommending different aspects in SNS’s is a new concept to make people socially sound. Community recommendation, connection or friendship recommendation, birthday reminder, event recommendation, restaurant or vacation spot recommender systems are common findings in the SNS’s. Recommending people on social networking sites is worth studying because it is different from traditional recommendations of books, movies, restaurants, etc. due to the social implications of “friending”. For example, before adding a friend, one has to consider a lot of things, whether he or she know the person personally or his or her likings, activities etc. match with the person he or she wants to add as a friend. Furthermore, the most challenging part in designing a recommendation system for a social network is the privacy issue of the users. With the ever increasing web crimes and identity theft, people are becoming more and more careful in sharing their personal information. Hence, unless a user can trust the system with their data, the system cannot stand and it will be valueless. Exploitation of social network data is the fragmentation of the population of social network users into numerous proprietary and closed social networks. This issue is compounded by the fact that each new game or media application tends to build its own social network around it rather than building upon the rich data available about existing social relationships.
